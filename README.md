```

- All solutions are stored inside the **`solutions/`** folder.
- File naming convention:  
   `<problem-number>_<problem-name>.py`  
   Example: `1_two-sum.py`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python (main), may include Java/C++ for practice.
- **Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

---

## 🚀 Usage: Add a New Problem

You can quickly generate a new solution file using the helper script **`new.sh`**.

### Run Command

```bash
bash new.sh "<problem-number>. <problem-title>"
```

or (if the script has execute permission):

```bash
./new.sh "<problem-number>. <problem-title>"
```

> ⚠️ If you see this error: `bash: ./new.sh: Permission denied`
> Run the following command once to grant execute permission:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x new.sh
> ```

### Examples

```bash
./new.sh "1. Two Sum"
./new.sh "2. Add Two Numbers"
./new.sh "3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters"
```

## 📖 Notes

Each solution file may include:

- **Code implementation**
- **Approach explanation (in comments)**
- **Time & space complexity analysis**
